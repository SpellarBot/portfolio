Your logo doesn’t mean shit.
Your brand does.


Above is a photo of a load of famous brands. All of them using Helvetica. Most of them pretty similar.

Does that matter? No.

Because it’s not about their logo. It’s about their brand.

It’s about them making a promise to a specific group of people.

It’s about them consistently delivering on that promise to that specific group of people.

It’s about that specific group of people telling other, similar people that there’s this company that promised to do this thing & they fulfilled that promise.

It’s not rocket science, right?

That message. That promise. That consistency. That relationship with the customer. That’s your brand.

And that’s the only thing that matters.
