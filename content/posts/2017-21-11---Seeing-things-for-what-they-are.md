It’s easy to be naïve; to accept what is said to you at face value, rather than probing the ulterior motives.

It makes it easier to deal with a complex world with complex people. So we trust people we probably shouldn’t trust. We are naïve even though somewhere inside of us is a voice telling us to get our guard up.

Trust is great. Society is founded upon & maintained by trust. But it’s wrong to trust when you know somebody’s true character.

When you know somebody is untrustworthy, do you naïvely think that this one seemingly kind act reveals their true character? That all the other unkind acts were exceptions & this is the rule?

Yet one act is enough sometimes. It sows the seeds of self-doubt. It stops you in your tracks. You start to think, /“Maybe they are a kind person. Maybe their actions are actions of pure generosity. Maybe I was wrong all along…”/

They know that. They know that because untrustworthy people are not as naïve. They know what the darker side of humanity looks like & imagine deception at every turn. They imagine every person is always ready to seize on opportunity, so they seize on any opportunity themselves.

So don’t turn around one day, surprised that you have been deceived.

There is an ulterior motive. There always is with some people.
