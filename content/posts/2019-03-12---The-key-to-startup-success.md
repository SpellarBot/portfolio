### *“Why do products fail?”*

Why, despite all the conventional advantages a startup may have (an experienced team, a load of investment, a rigorous product development process), do products still seem to fail?

This is the question I have been focused on answering over the last 6 years of my life. It is a journey that has taken me to 4 continents, working in a variety of product teams, industries and roles in the pursuit of an answer.

It has taken me 6 years to come up with  a conclusive answer. An answer I will outline in the next section.

And with an estimated 90% of new ventures failing to become profitable, self-sustaining businesses, it’s a question that should be very much pertinent to you, whether you are an entrepreneur, product manager or currently working in a startup.

With such a high rate of failure, something in the conventional wisdom of the startup world is broken. A conventional approach simply does not work.

I believe it’s time for a new approach to how we build products in order to engineer product -and business - success.



#### Searching for an Answer

In 2013, I founded my first business, a travel app called BackTracker, following the conventional wisdom of our mentors, our accelerator programme, other founders, academics and product books.

Yet nothing seemed to be working: raising investment didn’t help us create value for our customers, a rigorous development process simply made us more efficient (but no more effective) , and our inexperience didn’t really stop us planning and executing what we wanted to build.

After a few years fluctuating between exhilarating promise and abject failure, we ran out of money and closed the business, no closer to answering the  fundamental questions underpinning what we were trying to achieve: Building a profitable business.

Since that still-painful failure, I have spent my time examining how to approach product development differently in order to give a team the best chance of success.

I have researched, developed &, most importantly, applied in the real world my ideas in order to develop an approach to engineer product success.

I don’t boast the credentials of having worked for Google, Amazon or some other monolithic tech stalwart.

I’ve coached a Google Drive founder, consulted with a few large European startups, sure, but the value of my insights really comes from the breadth of experience, built up over numerous teams, in numerous industries, in numerous roles to test, iterate & hone my unique approach to building successful products.

That process, one of focusing on building three core foundations to product success, has led me to where I am today:

Helping other startups engineer product success through my work as a product strategist and consultant.

Building my own startup, [Scribe](http://www.scribeapp.co), as a self-sustainable, profitable business to help people suffering from anxiety find calm & clarity in their lives.

#### A Choice

*Aren’t you tired of wasting your time - wasting your life, even - building things that create no value?*

Working for months on a new feature or business that nobody uses? That makes no money? That ends up quickly thrown away and forgotten as you turn to your next project, one also doomed to failure?

If you actually want to create value with your work, there is another way.

A way where you can engineer success for your product and for your business. Where you can follow a framework, laying the right foundations to work effectively as a product team, to give yourself the best chance of success.

A way where you can approach your work calmly, rationally, making high-quality decisions to build the best product business - and to actually enjoy your work each day.
